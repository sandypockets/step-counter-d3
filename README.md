# Step Counter
Step Counter is a simple step counter interface, built with Express.js, and D3.js. The data behind the counter is currently static, however it could be quickly adapted to use live data. The barchart (representing number of steps taken each hour), and the circles (the number of steps taken each day) are created dynamically using D3. The purpose of this project is to gain familiarity with D3, therefore, it is heavily commented.

## Getting Started

1. Fork or clone the repository
2. From the directory root, run `npm install`
3. Run the `npm start` command to start the server. The Step Counter can then be viewed in your browser, at [`localhost:3000`](localhost:3000)

## Dependencies
D3 is included in the `public/scripts/` directory. Only EJS related dependencies require installation.

# Express Template

This template is a living, breathing organism. It will be improved upon over time, in an effort to reduce the amount of time to MVP when working with Express.

## New to Express? Get the TL;DR
This project doubles as a perfect sandbox for newer developers. Since it can be challenging to put all the pieces together without knowing what you're looking for, this readme is intentionally verbose. That said, this project assumes some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and of course, reading the docs is never a bad idea either. 

* Skim the EJS GitHub [readme](https://github.com/tj/ejs#ejs), and have a look at the [guide](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) on Expressjs.com.

### Views
Views are essentially your pages. The routes, like `index.js`, in the `routes/` directory (along with `app.js`) are responsible for serving up those pages. 

In `routes/index.js` you can see the following route:

```
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });
});
```

The `router.get('/)` portion represents a `GET` request to the `app.js` server. The server's response (`res`) is to `render` the `index` `view`, which is the `views/index.ejs` file.

### Partials
Throughout the app, you'll see partial templates, like `_header`, that are injected into other templates, like `index.ejs`. Representing a partial in a template looks like this: `<%- include('partials/_header') %>` Learn more about partials in the [EJS docs - #Includes](https://github.com/tj/ejs#includes).

These partials go beyond injecting a header alone. Use them to keep your views clean and readable. 

### `templateVars`
When a template, like `index.ejs`, is rendered, you can pass variables to the template. `templateVars` are used to get data from the back-end of your app, to the front-end.

Using the same example again, the template is being passed an object (`{ title: 'Express'}`) as a variable.

```
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });
});
```

With this variable being passed in, the object will be available within the `index.ejs` template. For example, `<p>Welcome to <%= title %></p>` will render as `<p>Welcome to Express</p>`

In case you haven't come across those funky `<%=` `%>` braces, they're unique to Express, and you can learn more about them in this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48522768/the-difference-between-and-in-ejs) question. Bear in mind, if you're writing multi-line JS in an `.ejs` file, you'll need to start and finish each individual line with those special EJS braces.
